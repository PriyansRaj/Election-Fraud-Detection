# 🗳️ Election Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect **anomalies and potential fraud** in election data using **machine learning**.
By analyzing patterns in voter turnout, vote distributions, and regional statistics, the system flags suspicious polling stations or regions that deviate from expected behavior.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Elections are critical to democracy, but fraudulent patterns—such as ballot stuffing, unrealistic turnout, or tampered counts—can compromise integrity.
This project builds an **anomaly detection model** that identifies irregularities using unsupervised ML techniques like **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor**.

It includes:

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Anomaly detection model
- Interactive dashboard for visualization (Streamlit)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyansRaj/election-fraud-detection.git
cd election-fraud-detection
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

#### Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

### 🧹 Step 1: Prepare your data

Place your raw election dataset (CSV) inside:

```
data/raw/
```

### 🧠 Step 2: Train or test the model

You can run notebooks or scripts in `/src` to train the anomaly detection model.

Example:

```bash
python src/anomaly_detection.py
```

### 💻 Step 3: Launch the Streamlit dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Then open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

Upload the processed dataset to view anomalies and statistics.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, streamlit, joblib
- **ML Techniques:** Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Streamlit

---

## 📈 Features

✅ Detects suspicious polling stations based on turnout and vote ratios
✅ Visualizes anomalies interactively
✅ Configurable thresholds for anomaly detection
✅ Modular code structure for easy extension

---

## 🔍 Example Insights

- Polling stations with **turnout > 95%** and **vote share skewed toward one candidate** may be flagged.
- Regions with **low invalid vote ratios** but **abnormally high turnout** could indicate irregular reporting.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real election data APIs
- Add geo-mapping visualization (Folium / Plotly Maps)
- Include supervised classification with synthetic labeled data
- Deploy as a public Streamlit web app
